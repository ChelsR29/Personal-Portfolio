# Personal-Portfolio

## Description

For this project I created the foundation of a portfolio I can use personally. Creating this project was used as a way for me to sharpen my CSS skills. After completing this project I have a better understanding of flex, positioning, margins, padding, borders, and overall how to style a page. Prework-studyguide deployed url used as a place holder for future applications.
